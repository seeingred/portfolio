# todo

- cache of static requests
+ number of digits support for currencies
+ eth tokens adding support
- percent of assets
+ hide values
+ comment to wallet (like it's my ledger address)
- avalanche tokens proper support
- when token added from chain add a comment from which chain it was added and amount. Later will be possible to add feature displaying token allocation by chains
- fetch asset name and precision when typed contract address
- new coins: celo, divi, vite, cosmos and parachains
+ unfortunately adding lighting support is not possible. That's why I still probably will going to need add static assets without an address.
- home button
- update number field




Different for each coin:
- Contract address / id / name of token
- Decimals of token
